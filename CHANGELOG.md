## [1.33](https://github.com/npapagna/cuis-code-coverage/compare/v1.32...v1.33) - 2022-08-21

### Changed

* Update `CodeCoverage` after a `SystemOrganizer` refactoring: use `SystemOrganizer>>#withSubCategoriesOf:` instead
  of `SystemOrganizer>>#categoriesMatching:`.
  Thanks for submitting this fix, @hernanwilkinson!

## [1.32](https://github.com/npapagna/cuis-code-coverage/compare/v1.31...v1.32) - 2021-11-27

### Fixed

* Do not filter out non-covered classes in the Code Coverage Browser.
  This bug causes pure abstract classes not to be displayed but their subclasses were still being indented, making
  them look like they are subclasses of the class that happened to be rendered before them.
  Thanks for the catch @hernanwilkinson!

## [1.31](https://github.com/npapagna/cuis-code-coverage/compare/v1.29...v1.31) - 2021-10-30

### Fixed

  Thanks @hernanwilkinson for the catch!

## [1.29](https://github.com/npapagna/cuis-code-coverage/compare/v1.28...v1.29) - 2021-08-26

### Fixed

* The way the source code is retrieved from method nodes in `CodeCoverageSourceCodeGenerator>>#value`.
  Thanks @hernanwilkinson for the catch and the fix!
